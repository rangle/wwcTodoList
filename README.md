# Let's Do Some Learning!

We're going to learn until we run out of time; but you can keep going, that's
totally fine.

Tonight we're learning about angular, and to do that we're doing a to do app.

## For this September, we have this agenda:

1. Let's make sure you've all got the files you'll need. They can be found on
github, but if that doesn't work for you, there are USB keys with the files you
can borrow, floating around (while still obeying the laws of gravity).
2. With the set up bits out of the way, we're going to get on with the learning
bit of the evening. The first subject of the night: *input databinding!* Hopefully
someone was paying more attention to what Della said than me. But I bet this
section is rad.
3. Then, simple *click events*. Clicking buttons is useful. So let's learn how to
set up buttons. First, we'll do something simple. Once we know this bit, we'll
be well positioned to do more complicated buttons a little later.
4. After that, showing the *list* of to do items. Lists of things are useful in
applications.
5. Once we have a list, we're going to leverage what we learned in step 3, and
add some *buttons* to the list items so we can modify the list items. We're going
to make it so you can mark the items as done (or delete them!)
6. We'll make it so that the list can be *filtered* next - if we're industrious
at adding things to the list, it's going to be helpful if we can search the list
to find particular items.
7. Hopefully we'll get to the bit where we introduce *animation* for the various
interactions. Whiz-slide-fade feels exciting and dynamic. Who wouldn't like to
have an exciting and dynamic to do list. 
8. *Directives* are the last thing we aspire to do in this course. They are a fab
way to bundle code and templates into reusable components. This app will only
need one directive; but we are pretty sure that they would be fantastic for the
apps you make after this course. We hope you get to this part even if we run out
of time.
